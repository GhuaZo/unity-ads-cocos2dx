# UnityAds SDK 2.0 Wrapper for Cocos2dx

This documentation introduces Unity Ads 2.0 wrapper APIs for Cocos2dx, for iOS and Android platforms only.

With this wrapper, you can somehow use UnityAds like using C++ api in case you are a Cocos2dx developer.

Although you do not need integrate Unity Ads in iOS and Android layer, no need implement C bridge or JNI manually, but still some file creation and settings file's modification needed. 

And you still need import Unity Ads 2.0 iOS and Android SDK libraries manually as well.
